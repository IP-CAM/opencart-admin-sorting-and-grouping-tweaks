@tik Admin Sorting and Grouping tweaks

Purpose
=======

We find that there a few tweaks in the  Admin Panel can save us a click or two, and in day-to-day operations, these clicks add up.

This extension makes the following tweaks:
1. AP > Catalog > Reviews
   OC lists reviews ordered by date added in ascending order (oldest first) by default. This extension reverses the default order (newest first) so that the reviews awaiting moderation are shown first.
2. AP > Reports > Sales > Orders
   OC lists sales grouped by week by default. We find it useful to look at sales (orders) grouped by month.

Because this is a vQmod, no core files are touched, and the changes should carry over to the next version.
